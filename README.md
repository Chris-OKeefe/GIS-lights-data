Some [notes](http://economics.mit.edu/files/8945) on using lights data

To do:
* Fix basic plotting issue
* Overlay US National Parks Data
* Extract data to generate park-level indicator
	* Consider removing 1 mile boundary around park border
* Find international national parks data for non-US sites
* Repeat for US Congressional districts, US counties (with population data?), US municipalities
